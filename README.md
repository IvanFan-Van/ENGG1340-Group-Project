Battleship Game!!!!!

This is a console-based implementation of the classic game Battleship, written in C++.  The game allows two players to compete against each other in a strategic naval battle.

Game Rules:
1.  Each player has a fleet of ships placed on a 10x10 grid.
2.  The ships include an aircraft carrier (5 cells), battleship (4 cells), cruiser (3 cells), submarine (3 cells), and destroyer (2 cells).
3.  Players take turns guessing the coordinates to target their opponent's ships.
4.  The grid is marked with hits ('X') and misses ('O') to keep track of the shots.
5.  When all cells of a ship are hit, it is considered sunk.
6.  The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.
